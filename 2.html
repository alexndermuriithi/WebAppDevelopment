			<p class = "textLeft"> 
				While planning for my wedding I encountered very many problems that seemed almost impossible to overcome. 
				Then like an angel in disguise I discovered myWedding<sup>TM</sup>.
			</p>
			<p class = "textLeft">
				This website expained to me what i needed to do and how to 
				prioritise the tasks that had to be accomplished. It gets better, since this is an online website everyone who is involved in the wedding planning
				has quick and easy access to the information and deadlines. This makes everything stress free!
